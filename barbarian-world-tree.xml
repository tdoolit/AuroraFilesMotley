            <p>Barbarians who follow the Path of the World Tree believe that their Rage links them to the cosmic ash tree Yggdrasil. This "world tree" grows among the Outer Planes, connecting them to each other and to the many worlds of the Material Plane, and the greatest plants on every world are said to be distant descendants of mighty Yggdrasil. These Barbarians draw on their connection to the world tree as a source of vitality and as a means of travel across the multiverse.</p>

            <p><em>3rd-level Path of the World Tree feature</em></p>
            <p>Your Rage taps into the lifeforce of the World Tree. You gain the following benefits:</p>
            <p style="text-indent: -1em; margin-left: 1em"><strong>Vitality Surge.</strong> When you activate your Rage, you gain a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to your Barbarian level.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: -1em; margin-left: 1em"><strong>Life-Giving Force.</strong> At the start of each of your turns while your Rage is active, you can choose another creature within 10 feet of yourself to gain Temporary Hit Points. To determine the number of Temporary hit Points, roll a number of d6s equal to your Rage Damage bonus, and add them together. If any of these Temporary Hit Points remain when your rage ends, they vanish. The range for this feature increases to 20 feet at level 10.</p>

            <p>While your Rage is active, whenever a creature you can see ends starts its turn within 30 feet of you, you can use your Reaction to summon spectral branches of the World Tree around it. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC equal to 8 plus your Proficiency Bonus plus your Strength modifier) or be teleported to an unoccupied space you can see within 5 feet of yourself or in the nearest unoccupied space you can see. The space the target teleports to must be on a surface or liquid that can support it; otherwise, the target doesn't teleport.</p>
            <p class="indent">After the target teleports, you can reduce its Speed to 0 until the end of the current turn.</p>
